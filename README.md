# Customer Banking Module Challenge 3
## Project Overview :
<p> The Customer Banking project is designed to use Classes to set the balance of the customer's savings and CD account.  The user is prompted to enter their savings and CD account balance, interest rate, and the length of months to determine the interest gained. The values the user enters are passed to functions  that are used to calculate the interest earned on the savings and CD account and then calculate the updated balance for both accounts the function returns the updated savings account balance, CD balance, and respective interest rates for both accounts back to the main function and then displays the interest earned on the savings and CD accounts and updates the balances.</p>

## Features of the project :
<p>This project uses classes, functions, and methods to calculate the customer's interest on their savings and CD accounts. The functions used to calculate the savings account interest and the CD account interest are
in separate .py files. Additionally, the Account Class is imported into the savings_account and cd_account .py files and the customer_banking file imports the cd_account and savings_account classes from the savings_account and cd_account .py files respectively.</p>
